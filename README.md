# Zola_Web_Scraper

Hi everybody,

In this project I built a web scraper that provides every real estate agent who wants to know the essential details about a lot/property in New York City from the official website of the City of New York.

How to use the tool?

Copy the code as it is, check that our machine has all the dependencies that need to be installed. (A dependencies document is attached in the project folder)

After all the installation of the suspensions if necessary, the code must be run by the following command:

**streamlit run myfile.py**

After running, the application will come up and you can enter the address on which we want to receive the details.

Image demonstrating the application:

You can test the application by entering the following address for an initial test:
 
**1281 St Johns PL Brooklyn, NY 11213**

The site from which I pull the data: **https://zola.planning.nyc.gov**
